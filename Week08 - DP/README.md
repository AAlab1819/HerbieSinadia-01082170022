First, the user inputs the number of bottle types and litres required. Then, the program will go to a loop where the user inputs the price of ```a```th bottle and determine the cheapest by comparing it with the previous entry. Then, the program will go to another loop to determine the final answer. The program will set a temporary value and add value of ```y``` by calculating current price index with litres/temp. Get the current answer counter by getting the lowest number between the current answer with the current price selection sequence. Then, print the final answer.
