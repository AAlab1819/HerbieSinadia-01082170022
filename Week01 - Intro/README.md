Problem 854 A - Fractions

Submission link: http://codeforces.com/contest/854/submission/42357446

Explanation: 
The problem asks us to create a program in which we input an integer which later outputs a fraction in which the sum of the numerator and denominator equals to the number inserted. The numerator and denominator must be a coprime number (no positive
common divisors except 1)

My solution to this problem is by performing operations depending on the number. First, I create two variables 'a' (the numerator) 
and 'b' (the denominator). I set the value for both variables as 99 for placeholder/temporary purposes. Then we go through an "if-else" statement depending whether the number is even or odd.

If the number is even, we get the numerator by dividing the original number by 2 and then subtracting it by 1 (a = (num/2)-1).
The denominator is then obtained by dividing the number by 2 and then adding it by 1 (b = (num/2)+1). In most cases, the numerator
and denominator generated by an even number are even.
  example: 36 -> 16 18 || 50 -> 24 26

But we're looking for coprime numbers, so I added another operation for the numerator and denominator. The program will go to 
"if" statements if the numerator and denominator are even. The numerator is subtracted by 1 (to make them odd/coprime) and the denominator is added by 1 (to make them odd/coprime). That's it for prime numbers!

As for odd numbers, it's much more simple and straightforward. We get the numerator by dividing the number by 2 (it's an integer
variable, so we only get an integer value rather than a float/double -> 13/2 == 6 || a = (num / 2)). Since it's an odd number, the numerator will always be odd/coprime number. The denominator is obtained by adding the numerator value by 1 (b = a + 1).
